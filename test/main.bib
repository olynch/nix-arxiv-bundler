After giving an extensive list of examples of convex sets as they appear throughout mathematics and theoretical physics, we find that there also exist convex spaces that cannot be embedded into a vector space: semilattices are a class of examples of purely combinatorial type. In an information-theoretic interpretation, convex subsets of vector spaces are probabilistic, while semilattices are possibilistic. Convex spaces unify these two concepts.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08321},
	abstract = {Long before the invention of Feynman diagrams, engineers were using similar diagrams to reason about electrical circuits and more general networks containing mechanical, hydraulic, thermodynamic and chemical components. We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by addition. In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop. A network with \$m\$ inputs and \$n\$ outputs is a morphism from \$m\$ to \$n\$, putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring. Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources. Each kind of circuit corresponds to a mathematically natural prop. We describe the "behavior" of these circuits using morphisms between props. In particular, we give a new proof of the black-boxing theorem proved by Fong and the first author; unlike the original proof, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components. We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control theory. Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props.},

	abstract = {Passive linear networks are used in a wide variety of engineering applications, but the best studied are electrical circuits made of resistors, inductors and capacitors. We describe a category where a morphism is a circuit of this sort with marked input and output terminals. In this category, composition describes the process of attaching the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another. We construct a functor, dubbed the "black box functor", that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior. Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals. The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation. Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to the category of symplectic vector spaces and Lagrangian linear relations. We prove that this functor is We prove that this functor is symmetric monoidal and indeed a hypergraph functor. We assume the reader is familiar with category theory, but not with circuit theory or symplectic linear algebra.},

In particular, we consider a category {FinStat} where an object is a finite set equipped with a probability distribution, while a morphism is a measure-preserving function \$f: X {\textbackslash}to Y\$ together with a stochastic right inverse \$s: Y {\textbackslash}to X\$. The function \$f\$ can be thought of as a measurement process, while s provides a hypothesis about the state of the measured system given the result of a measurement. Given this data we can define the entropy of the probability distribution on \$X\$ relative to the "prior" given by pushing the probability distribution on \$Y\$ forwards along \$s\$. We say that \$s\$ is "optimal" if these distributions agree. We show that any convex linear, lower semicontinuous functor from {FinStat} to the additive monoid \$[0,{\textbackslash}infty]\$ which vanishes when \$s\$ is optimal must be a scalar multiple of this relative entropy. Our proof is independent of all earlier characterizations, but inspired by the work of Petz.},

We will show how to think of a Dirichlet polynomial as a set-theoretic bundle, and thus as an empirical distribution. We can then consider the Shannon entropy \$H(d)\$ of the corresponding probability distribution, and we define its length (or, classically, its perplexity) by \$L(d)=2{\textasciicircum}\{H(d)\}\$. On the other hand, we will define a rig homomorphism \$h{\textbackslash}colon{\textbackslash}mathsf\{Dir\}{\textbackslash}to{\textbackslash}mathsf\{Rect\}\$ from the rig of Dirichlet polynomials to the so-called rectangle rig, whose underlying set is \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}geq0\}{\textbackslash}times{\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}geq0\}\$ and whose additive structure involves the weighted geometric mean; we write \$h(d)=(A(d),W(d))\$, and call the two components area and width (respectively). The main result of this paper is the following: the rectangle-area formula \$A(d)=L(d)W(d)\$ holds for any Dirichlet polynomial \$d\$. In other words, the entropy of an empirical distribution can be calculated entirely in terms of the homomorphism \$h\$ applied to its corresponding Dirichlet polynomial. We also show that similar results hold for the cross entropy.},

Although complex dynamical systems tend to have important modular structure, conventional modeling approaches suppress this structure. Building on recent work in applied category theory, we show how deterministic dynamical systems, discrete and continuous, can be composed in a hierarchical style. In mathematical terms, we reformulate some existing operads of wiring diagrams and introduce new ones, using the general formalism of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$-sets (copresheaves). We then establish dynamical systems as algebras of these operads. In a computational vein, we show that Euler's method is functorial for undirected systems, extending a previous result for directed systems. All the ideas in this paper are implemented as practical software using Catlab and the {AlgebraicJulia} ecosystem, written in the Julia programming language for scientific computing.},

Instead of focusing on the entropy of a probability measure on a finite set, this characterization focuses on the `information loss', or change in entropy, associated with a measure-preserving function. Information loss is a special case of conditional entropy: namely, it is the entropy of a random variable conditioned on some function of that variable. We show that Shannon entropy gives the only concept of information loss that is functorial, convex-linear and continuous. This characterization naturally generalizes to Tsallis entropy as well.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09581},
	abstract = {We share a small connection between information theory, algebra, and topology—namely, a correspondence between Shannon entropy and derivations of the operad of topological simplices. We begin with a brief review of operads and their representations with topological simplices and the real line as the main example. We then give a general deﬁnition for a derivation of an operad in any category with values in an abelian module over the operad. The main result is that Shannon entropy deﬁnes a derivation of the operad of topological simplices, and that for every derivation of this operad there exists a point at which it is given by a constant multiple of Shannon entropy. We show this is compatible with, and relies heavily on, a well-known characterization of entropy given by Faddeev in 1956 and a recent variation given by Leinster.},
